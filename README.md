This is a repository for the spectral anomaly detection paper presented at FPT2014.

## Usage

`sw_matlab` contains a matlab implementation, for the data please refer to [SAX](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/SAX.htm) website.

`sw_c` contains a basic c example that generates a continuous signal with anomalies. 

## FPGA

`hw_impl_1` contains the vivado hls source code for the results obtained in the paper.

`hw_impl_2` is an improved version of `hw_impl_1`
